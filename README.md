# Fruit Company Renderer

This is a work-in-progress Apple Metal renderer for Unreal Engine 1-based games. The current plan is to include this renderer in OldUnreal's v469e patch for Unreal Tournament.

## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

You can only build this renderer if you have full source code access to an Unreal Engine 1 game. You will also need to a fairly recent version of metal-cpp.

### CMake

A top-level CMake file that builds an entire Unreal Engine 1 game will be included in OldUnreal's SDK for Unreal Tournament v469e.
